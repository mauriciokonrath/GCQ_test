The `Quantum Computing Group at the Federal University of Santa Catarina <http://gcq.ufsc.br>`_ was established in 2017 with the goal of producing high-level scientific research in the field of quantum computing, as well as bringing this knowledge to the general public.
Involving students and professors of Computer Science and Physics departaments, the group has contributed to the development of several branches of quantum computing and information, such as quantum simulation, quantum programming language, quantum algorithms, errors in quantum processors, quantum correlations, classical Machine Learning to optimize quantum processes, among others.
With the objective of taking quantum technologies to students, workers and entrepreneurs in the technology sector in the state of Santa Catarina, the group has organized annually, since 2018, the event `Quantum Computing Workshop at UFSC <https://workshop-cq.ufsc.br>`_ which we offer hackathons, lectures and mini-courses given by scientists and entrepreneurs in the sector from Brazil and abroad.
Come and help us put Brazil on the map of quantum technologies in the world.
